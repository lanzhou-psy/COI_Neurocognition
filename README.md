# COI_Neurocognition
This repository stored scripts for the COI and neurocogniton project using ABCD database.


We have three study aims in this project.

Aim 1: corss-sectional assocations between COI and cognitive function, and brain structures at baseline.

Aim 2: The relative contribution of three COI domains to cognitive function and brain structurs at baseline.

Aim 3: The strutural equation models to examine the mediation roles of brain strutures between COI at baseline and cognitive function at 2-year follow-up
