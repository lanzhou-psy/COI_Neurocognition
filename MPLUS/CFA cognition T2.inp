TITLE: SEM to examine indirect effects of brain structure on COI and cognitive function;
DATA: FILE IS "D:/OneDrive/mplus/input/SEM_vol.csv";

! this file is CFA analysis for the five cognitive function measures at 2 year-follow up

CLUSTER = rel_family_id_t1;
STRATIFICATION = site_id_l_t1;


ANALYSIS:
    TYPE = COMPLEX;
    ESTIMATOR = ML;  ! Use ML or MLR (robust to non-normality)
 !   BOOTSTRAP = 10000;  ! Bootstrapping for confidence intervals

MODEL:
  ! Latent factors
  GA BY picvo reading;
  EF BY picture flanker pattern;

  GA WITH EF;

  EF ON age_t1;

OUTPUT: 
  CINTERVAL (BOOTSTRAP);  ! Confidence intervals for indirect effects via bootstrapping
  STDYX;   ! Standardized estimates
  TECH1;   ! Parameter specifications
  TECH4;   ! Latent variable covariances
  !MODINDICES (ALL);  ! Modification indices for model respecification if needed
  RESIDUAL;  ! Residuals for model diagnostics
